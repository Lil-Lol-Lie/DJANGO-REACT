1. Create Models (Database Layer):
Purpose: Define the structure of your data and how it will be stored in the database.
2. Convert Models to JSON (Serialization Layer):
Purpose: Convert the data from the models into JSON format for easy transmission over the web (e.g., via APIs).
3. Create Views (Controller Layer):
Purpose: Handle the logic of your application, such as fetching data, processing it, and sending the appropriate response.
4. Setting Up URLs (Routing Layer):
Purpose: Map URLs to the appropriate views so users can interact with your API.
5. User Interaction:
Purpose: Allow users to interact with the data via the frontend or API clients.
In summary, you start by defining the structure of your data with models, then convert this data to/from JSON with serializers, and finally set up views and URLs to handle user interactions, making sure to enforce permissions and business logic as needed.
